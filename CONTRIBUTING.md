# Contributing to MapChain Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the world's first truly decentralized mapping solution!

## How to Contribute

### Adding More Buzzwords

We're always looking for more blockchain buzzwords to add to the project. Current favorites include:

- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Proof-of-location
- Trustless consensus
- Immutable ledger
- Gas fees
- Layer 2 scaling
- Sharding
- Tokenomics

### Making the Offset More "Decentralized"

Currently, we use a simple random offset. If you have ideas for making this more absurd while maintaining the joke, please share!

### UI Improvements

Want to make the UI more "crypto-y"? Go for it! Think:
- More green pulsing dots
- Fake transaction hashes
- Meaningless graphs
- "Blockchain verified" badges
- Fake wallet connections

## Code Style

Please maintain the same level of tongue-in-cheek commentary in your code comments.

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure your changes make the joke funnier or more elaborate
2. Update the README if you add new "features"
3. Add blockchain buzzwords to your PR description for maximum effect
4. Submit and await "consensus" from the maintainers

## Code of Conduct

Be nice. It's a joke project. Have fun with it.
